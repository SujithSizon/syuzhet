At the April 2015 UVa / Charlottesville R User Group meetup, I presented on how to do some *quick and dirty* sentiment analysis with R. The presentation featured the **syuzhet** package and its text mining capabilities. Alternative techniques using **qdap** and **tm** were briefly mentioned. 

The script associated with this presentation walks through three scenarios for sentiment analysis:

1. Examining narrative
2. Analyzing sentiment of Twitter data
3. Analyzing sentiment of open-ended survey responses

Each example includes some manipulation (mostly with **dplyr** and **tidyr**) as well as plots (mostly with **ggplot2**).
